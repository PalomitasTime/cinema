### How it works
Simply provide a torrent or magnet link, and the movie file within the torrent will start
streaming instantly.

### Supported formats
Currently Cinema only supports [MP4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14)
files for playing movies.

### Work in progress
The project is in its early stages of development. Some things might not work as intended.
